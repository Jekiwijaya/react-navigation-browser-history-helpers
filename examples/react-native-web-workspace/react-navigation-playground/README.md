# Navigation Playground Example

## react-navigation-playground

> this project belongs to react-navigation

A playground for experimenting with react-navigation in a pure-JS React Native app.

### react-navigation-playground and components folder

This standalone library contain the main app shared among platforms.

it has `react-native` and `react-navigation` as peerDependencies and a `utils` module symlinked

This is not transpiled because source maps are not working as I expect even with the usage of `--source-maps`.

The following improvements and PR could be accepted:
